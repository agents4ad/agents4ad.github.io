title: 'Workshop on Traffic Agent Modeling for Autonomous Driving Simulation'
excerpt: 'An IEEE/RSJ IROS 2023 workshop.'
---

This workshop will be held at the [IEEE/RSJ IROS 2023](https://ieee-iros.org/), on October 5th, 2023, in Detroit, USA and streamed online.

## Abstract

Simulation is a crucial tool to accelerate the development of Autonomous Driving (AD) algorithms. Realistic traffic agent models reduce the sim-to-real gap and have the potential to massively scale evaluation of AD algorithms, paying into both development and safe deployment of AD systems.

Research in traffic agent modeling has recently made great advances, for example due to the switch to graph neural networks and training through sequential decisions. Yet, the research is scattered over different robotics and machine learning venues.

This workshop shall provide a platform to highlight recent advances and future directions towards realistic traffic agent models. Furthermore, this workshop shall provide insights from related fields such as prediction, motion planning and AV safety. Through a mix of invited talks from both academia and industry, paper presentations, and a panel discussion, attendees will be able to catch up with the latest advances, promising directions and most pressing challenges. Attendees will also be able to network in this growing field of research and related areas.
