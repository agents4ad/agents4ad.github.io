This workshop will be held at the [CVPR 2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024), on either **June 17th or 18th, 2024** in Seattle, USA and streamed online.

## ðŸš§ Under construction

Please stay tuned for updates! Call for papers will follow soon, as will our tentative agenda. You can checkout the [2023 edition at IROS](2023), which had a smaller scope, meanwhile.
