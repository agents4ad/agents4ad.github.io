This workshop will be held at the [IEEE/RSJ IROS 2023](https://ieee-iros.org/), on **October 5th, 2023, in Detroit**, USA and streamed online.

## Abstract

Simulation is a crucial tool to accelerate the development of Autonomous Driving (AD) algorithms. Realistic traffic agent models reduce the sim-to-real gap and have the potential to massively scale evaluation of AD algorithms, paying into both development and safe deployment of AD systems.

Research in traffic agent modeling has recently made great advances, for example due to the switch to graph neural networks and training through sequential decisions. Yet, the research is scattered over different robotics and machine learning venues.

This workshop shall provide a platform to highlight recent advances and future directions towards realistic traffic agent models. Furthermore, this workshop shall provide insights from related fields such as prediction, motion planning and AV safety. Through a mix of invited talks from both academia and industry, paper presentations, and a panel discussion, attendees will be able to catch up with the latest advances, promising directions and most pressing challenges. Attendees will also be able to network in this growing field of research and related areas.

## Call for Contributions

Any type of contribution, either already published or work in progress, is welcome to our workshop.

Accepted papers will be presented in a poster session (with a 1 minute spotlight teaser each). All submitted contributions will go through a single-blind review process on openreview. The contributed papers will be made available on the workshopâ€™s website and on openreview. However, this does not constitute an archival publication and no formal workshop proceedings will be made available, meaning contributors are free to publish their work in archival journals or conferences.

Beyond contributions towards traffic agent modeling for AD simulation directly, we also encourage submissions from related research areas.

## Important Dates

- **Submissions open:** June 1st, 2023
- **Submissions due:** August 1st, 2023
- **Notification of acceptance:** August 21st, 2023
  - Note: To allow for travel planning, we will notify at the latest 30 days after submission.
- **Camera ready paper upload**: September 1st, 2023
- **Spotlight/teaser video upload**: September 10th, 2023
- **Poster upload**: September 15th, 2023

## Location

The room in the venue and the link will be shared here, once available.
